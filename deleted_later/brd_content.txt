1. Document Overview
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for implementing a password policy that enforces the inclusion of at least 8 characters and numbers.
2. Objective
The objective of this document is to ensure that the password policy enforces security best practices by requiring passwords to be a minimum of 8 characters in length and contain at least one numerical digit.

- Password validation must occur both on the client-side (if applicable) and server-side.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
- Password validation must complete within 1 second.
- All password-related data must be handled securely according to industry standards.
6. Acceptance Criteria
- Users cannot proceed unless a valid password is entered.
